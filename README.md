### Abstract
The Quiz Game is a simple console-based application designed to test users' knowledge on computer science topics. The program presents a series of multiple-choice questions, evaluates user responses, and provides feedback on correctness. It aims to enhance the user's understanding of computer history and technology through interactive learning. The game keeps track of the user's score, culminating in a summary of performance at the end.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Development Environment:** Any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or any IDE that supports C programming such as Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).
- **Input/Output Libraries:** The program uses the standard I/O library (`<stdio.h>`) for handling input and output operations.

### Key Points
1. **User Interaction:** 
   - The program begins with a welcoming message and instructions on how to play the quiz.
   - Users are prompted to enter their answers using numeric input corresponding to the multiple-choice options.

2. **Question Structure:**
   - A total of five questions are presented, each focused on different aspects of computer science.
   - Each question has four options, with one correct answer.

3. **Scoring System:**
   - The program maintains a score counter (`score`) that increments for each correct answer.
   - Feedback is provided immediately after each question, indicating whether the user's answer was correct or wrong.

4. **Answer Evaluation:**
   - The program uses a `switch` statement for evaluating user answers, which makes it easy to add more questions or modify existing ones.
   - It displays the correct answer after a wrong response to enhance learning.

5. **Quiz Summary:**
   - At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed, providing users with a summary of their performance.

6. **Educational Purpose:**
   - The quiz content focuses on historical figures and developments in computing, making it educational for users interested in the field.

7. **Code Readability:**
   - The code is organized and structured, with clear comments explaining each section, making it easy to understand and maintain.

This Quiz Game serves as an excellent starting point for beginners learning C programming while also providing a fun and interactive way to learn about computer science concepts. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as timed questions, a wider range of topics, or even a graphical user interface.![Screenshot 2024-08-15 150239](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c177b78d-b8bd-4326-93bf-2601a5491a3a)
